## Guide

### 1. Loading the script

To load the script you have to copy the content of the **dist/bundle.js** into the browser terminal.
Or you could use the raw github file as a reference and enter it into your quick bar or terminal:

```js
javascript:$.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KincsesBence/TW-attack-planner/main/dist/bundle.js", (r) => { Function(`${r}`)();}); void(0);
```

### 2. Startup window

On the startup window you can load, create and delete your attack plans. When you're creating a new plan, first you have to navigate through, the creation wizard's steps:

- Naming your plan (you can not have duplicate names)
- Adding the targets (you have to paste cordinates into the textarea in a recognizable pattern)
- Choosing the ingame launcher groups (you can add multiple, it creates a union of the villages)
- Adding arrivals (you can add multiple arrival dates)
- Creating templates (you can add multiple templates. template values can hold negative numbers)
